!! Monte Carlo model for simulating the slowing down of photoelectrons in atomic and
!!   molecular gases in the local deposition approximation.
!! Author: Antonio GARCIA MUÑOZ (tonhingm@gmail.com) 
!! 
!! Version v1 works with H and He atoms plus thermal electrons. The model is described in: 
!!   García Muñoz, Icarus, Volume 392, 1 March 2023, 115373
!!   https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2022.115373
!! 
!! Version v2 extends v1 to work with O and O+ atoms and deal with double ionization.

!!   non-thermal electrons in the upper atmospheres of water-rich exoplanets
!!   https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202245766
!!
!! Version v3 extends v2 to work with H2, H2O and O2 molecules and deal with: rotational &
!!   vibrational excitation; dissociation into neutrals and dissociative attachment.
!!
!! The model is available on https://antoniogarciamunoz.wordpress.com/ and
!!   upon email request (tonhingm@gmail.com) from the author.
